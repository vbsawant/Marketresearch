# Autoclaved Aerated Concrete Market Research Report Analysis by Fact MR
The global autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) market is projected to reach a value of US$ 11.8 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.1%, reaching US$ 19.9 billion by 2033.

Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) is a highly efficient, lightweight building material that has gained significant traction in the construction industry. Known for its thermal insulation properties, fire resistance, and ease of use, AAC is increasingly being used in the construction of both residential and commercial buildings. It is made from natural raw materials, including sand, lime, cement, water, and aluminum powder, which undergo a process of autoclaving to form aerated blocks or panels. The growth of the global construction sector and the rising demand for sustainable, energy-efficient materials are key factors driving the expansion of the AAC market. Moreover, AAC is widely recognized for its environmentally friendly characteristics, such as low carbon emissions during production, making it a preferred choice in green building projects.
