# Aliphatic Solvents Market Size & Trend Analysis by Fact MR
The global aliphatic solvents market is projected to reach a valuation of US$ 2.1 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.0%, reaching US$ 3.4 billion by 2033.

Aliphatic solvents are a key category of organic solvents derived from hydrocarbons, commonly used in various industries for their ability to dissolve or dilute substances. These solvents are typically derived from petroleum and feature straight-chain or branched hydrocarbon structures. Aliphatic solvents find applications in the automotive, paint and coatings, pharmaceutical, and cleaning industries due to their mild odor, low toxicity, and effectiveness in various chemical formulations. Their ability to break down oils, resins, and other materials while maintaining a relatively low level of reactivity makes them indispensable for diverse industrial applications, further driving demand across a range of sectors.
