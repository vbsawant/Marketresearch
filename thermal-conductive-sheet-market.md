# Thermal Conductive Sheet Market Growth, Trends, Product Scope & Forecast by Fact MR
The global thermal conductive sheet market, valued at USD 1.26 billion in 2023, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4% and reach USD 2.13 billion by 2033.

The term 'thermal conductive sheet' refers to a thin film that forms the thermal interface material. Thermally conductive powder is mixed with silicone resin, which has good heat resistance and electrical insulating capabilities, to make the product. A material's capacity to conduct heat is determined by its thermal conductivity. High thermal conductivity materials may efficiently move heat and easily absorb heat from their surroundings. The ability of a material to conduct or transport heat is referred to as "thermal conductivity".
