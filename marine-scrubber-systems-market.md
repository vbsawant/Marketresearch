# Marine Scrubber Systems Market Key Drivers & Forecast by Fact MR

The global demand for marine scrubber systems is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.4%. Market revenue, valued at US$ 6.34 billion in 2022, is projected to reach US$ 17.06 billion by 2032.

The marine scrubber systems market has gained significant traction in recent years due to the growing need to reduce sulfur emissions from ships. As global maritime regulations tighten, particularly with the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 2020 sulfur cap that mandates a reduction in sulfur content in marine fuel to 0.5%, marine scrubber systems have emerged as a key solution. These systems, also known as exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS), allow ships to continue using high-sulfur fuel oil while still complying with environmental regulations by removing sulfur oxides (SOx) from exhaust gases before they are released into the atmosphere. The market encompasses various types of scrubber systems, including open-loop, closed-loop, and hybrid systems, each offering different methods of managing washwater and exhaust. As the shipping industry continues to seek cost-effective and compliant solutions to meet environmental standards, the marine scrubber systems market is expected to see sustained growth.

Market Insights

Insights into the marine scrubber systems market reveal that it is driven by both regulatory pressures and economic considerations. The adoption of marine scrubbers allows ship operators to avoid the high costs associated with low-sulfur marine fuels, providing a more economical alternative for long-term compliance. Open-loop scrubbers, which use seawater to wash exhaust gases and discharge the effluent back into the sea, have been widely adopted due to their relatively lower initial costs. However, concerns about environmental impact in certain regions have led to a growing interest in closed-loop and hybrid systems, which either recirculate the washwater or switch between open and closed modes depending on the location and environmental regulations. The market is also influenced by the age and type of vessels, with retrofitting older ships posing challenges in terms of space and integration.

Market Demand

The demand for marine scrubber systems is driven by the need for shipping companies to comply with international and regional emissions regulations while maintaining operational efficiency. The introduction of the IMO 2020 sulfur cap was a significant catalyst for the adoption of scrubber technology, particularly among operators of large vessels that consume high volumes of fuel. The ability to continue using cheaper high-sulfur fuel oil while still meeting emissions standards has made scrubbers an attractive investment for many shipowners. Moreover, as environmental concerns grow, there is increasing pressure from stakeholders, including governments, environmental organizations, and the public, to reduce the maritime industry's environmental footprint. This pressure is likely to sustain and even increase demand for scrubber systems in the coming years, particularly as additional environmental regulations are introduced and enforcement mechanisms become more stringent.

Notable Developments

Notable developments in the marine scrubber systems market include advancements in technology, regulatory changes, and shifts in industry practices. In recent years, there has been significant innovation in scrubber design, with manufacturers developing more compact and efficient systems that are easier to install and maintain. The introduction of hybrid scrubbers, which can switch between open-loop and closed-loop modes, has provided shipowners with greater flexibility in meeting varying environmental regulations. On the regulatory front, some regions have introduced stricter controls on washwater discharge from open-loop scrubbers, prompting shipowners to consider closed-loop or hybrid systems. Additionally, several high-profile shipowners and operators have announced large-scale investments in scrubber technology as part of their long-term sustainability strategies. These developments reflect the dynamic nature of the marine scrubber systems market as it continues to adapt to evolving environmental standards and technological advancements.

Competitive Landscape

The marine scrubber systems market is highly competitive, with established players focusing on organic growth strategies like product launches, approvals, acquisitions, and expansions to enhance their market presence. Recent developments include partnerships and agreements aimed at advancing scrubber technologies. For instance, in September 2022, CR Ocean Engineering partnered with Oberlin Filter Company for a cost-effective filtration system, and in June 2018, Frontline acquired a 20% stake in Feen Marine Scrubbers. Other notable developments include Mitsubishi's launch of a large-scale scrubber in 2017 and Valmet's 2020 contract with Mitsubishi Shipbuilding for hybrid scrubber systems.
